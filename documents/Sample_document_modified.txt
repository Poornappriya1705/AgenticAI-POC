What is data science?
Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review. Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to improve business outcomes.
The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:
Data ingestion: The lifecycle begins with the data collection—both raw structured and unstructured data from all relevant sources using a variety of methods. These methods can include manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices. Data sources can include structured data, such as customer data, along with unstructured data like log files, video, audio, pictures, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, and more.
Data storage and data processing: Since data can have different formats and structures, companies need to consider different storage systems based on the type of data that needs to be captured. Data management teams help to set standards around data storage and structure, which facilitate workflows around analytics, machine learning and deep learning models. This stage includes cleaning data, deduplicating, transforming and combining the data using ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs or other data integration technologies. This data preparation is essential for promoting data quality before loading into a data warehouse, data lake, or other repository.
Data analysis: Here, data scientists conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, ranges, and distributions of values within the data. This data analytics exploration drives hypothesis generation for a/b testing. It also allows analysts to determine the data’s relevance for use within modeling efforts for predictive analytics, machine learning, and/or deep learning. Depending on a model’s accuracy, organizations can become reliant on these insights for business decision making, allowing them to drive more scalability.
Communicate: Finally, insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations that make the insights—and their impact on business—easier for business analysts and other decision-makers to understand. A data science programming language such as R or Python includes components for generating visualizations; alternately, data scientists can use dedicated visualization tools.

- The original text lacks a clear and concise definition of data science, which is addressed by rephrasing the first sentence to: "Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines math and statistics, programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning with domain expertise to uncover actionable insights from an organization's data."

- The text jumps abruptly from discussing the growth of the field to describing the data science lifecycle. To improve flow, the paragraph about the growth of the field is rephrased to: "The accelerating volume of data sources has made data science one of the fastest-growing fields across every industry, earning the role of the data scientist the title of 'sexiest job of the 21st century' by Harvard Business Review."

- The text uses vague language when describing the data science lifecycle, which is addressed by breaking it down into more specific stages and providing examples of each. For instance, the stage of data ingestion is rephrased to: "Data ingestion involves collecting both structured and unstructured data from various sources, including manual entry, web scraping, and real-time streaming data from systems and devices."

- The text lacks clarity when describing the process of data storage and processing. To improve understanding, this section is rephrased to: "Data storage and processing involve selecting the appropriate storage system based on the type of data, setting standards for data storage and structure, and using data integration technologies to clean, deduplicate, transform, and combine the data."

- The text uses overly technical language when describing data analysis, which is addressed by rephrasing it to: "Data scientists conduct exploratory data analysis to examine biases, patterns, and distributions within the data, generating hypotheses for a/b testing and determining the data's relevance for modeling efforts."

- The text lacks clarity when describing the communication stage, which is addressed by rephrasing it to: "Insights are presented as reports and data visualizations that make the insights and their impact on business easier for business analysts and decision-makers to understand, using programming languages like R or Python or dedicated visualization tools."
